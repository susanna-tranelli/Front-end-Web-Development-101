      <h1>Interneting is Easy</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic of HTML</p>

      <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings</p>

      <h2>Lists</h2>
         <p>This is how you make an unordered list</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
            <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
          </ul>
         <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
            <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
            <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
            <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
          </ol>
      <h2>Inlines</h2>
        <p><em>Sometimes</em> you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
        <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase</p>
      <h2>Empty elements</h2>
